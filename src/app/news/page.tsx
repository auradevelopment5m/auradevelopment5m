          <p className="text-sm text-gray-400">Posted on {new Date().toLocaleDateString()}</p>
        </CardHeader>
        <CardContent>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Aura Development has taken a significant step in protecting the FiveM development community by introducing
            VWarden, an advanced anti-leaking tool, to its Discord server.
          </p>
          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Why VWarden?</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            The decision to implement VWarden stems from a commitment to support and protect developers in the FiveM
            community. Leaking has become a prevalent issue, demotivating developers and impacting their livelihoods.
            VWarden aims to create a safer environment for creators and maintain the integrity of the development
            community.
          </p>
          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">What is VWarden?</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            VWarden is a sophisticated tool developed by a group of developers dedicated to combating leaking, cheating,
            and other forms of ToS violations. It actively monitors and prevents unauthorized distribution of
            proprietary code and resources.
          </p>
          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Key Features:</h2>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
            <li>
              User Verification: Members can check their status and ensure they&apos;re not associated with known
              leaking communities.
            </li>
            <li>Server Checking: Ability to verify the legitimacy of FiveM-related Discord servers.</li>
            <li>Comprehensive Database: Maintains a list of servers involved in reselling or leaking activities.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mb-4">Users can interact with VWarden using the following commands:</p>
          <pre className="bg-zinc-800 p-4 rounded-md overflow-x-auto">
            <code>
              {`/checkself -- View your own status
/checkuser -- Check the status of any Aura Development guild member
/checkserver (guild id) -- Verify the status of specific servers
/badservers -- Display a list of all known problematic servers`}
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p className="mt-4">
            Aura Development remains committed to fostering a fair and motivating environment for FiveM developers. The
